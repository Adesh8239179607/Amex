# OfferRank â€” Learning-to-Rank for Personalized Offers

ðŸš€ **Problem Statement**  
Customers are often shown multiple offers at once. If those offers are not **ranked effectively**, user engagement drops.  
Most predictive models treat offers independently (clicked vs. not clicked), but this misses the **bigger picture**: what matters is **ranking the entire list by relevance**.

## ðŸ”‘ Our Strategy

We built a **learning-to-rank system** that captures real behavior, extracts meaningful features, and optimizes directly for ranking quality.

### 1. Capturing Real Behavior
- Smart **negative sampling** (5:1 ratio) of non-clicked offers.  
- No synthetic oversampling â€” we preserved authentic user interactions.

### 2. Extracting Powerful Signals
- **Temporal:** Offer recency, daily/hourly activity patterns, and decay-based weighting.  
- **Behavioral:** User CTR history, offer fatigue, impression gaps, and recency delay.  
- **Semantic:** **TF-IDF embeddings** on offer descriptions, categories, and codes.  
- **Spending:** User-level spend patterns (mean, variance, variability).

### 3. Optimizing for Relevance
- **Model:** LightGBM Ranker (LambdaRank objective).  
- **Tuning:** Optuna for Bayesian hyperparameter search.  
- **Validation:** Grouped folds on user ID (`id2`) to prevent leakage.
